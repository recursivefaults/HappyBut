HappyBut
========

A simple tool for managers in a company to keep a pulse on the happiness of their employees.

Why would any company want this? Well, it can be hard to get employees at any level to feel comfortable confessing their
true feelings about their work environment. Even in the best case where opinions can be shared freely, those who have the
ability and authority to make a difference are usually to far and few between. This provides a simple place for all of
these message to be collected and viewed anonymously so people know what is really going on in the company.

You should strongly consider using this on an intranet only.
